# PsycheNet: Decentralized Collective Unconscious Mapping Platform

## üåê Project Overview

PsycheNet is a groundbreaking platform designed to explore and map the collective unconscious through advanced blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cross-cultural research methodologies. By creating a secure, collaborative ecosystem, we aim to uncover deep patterns of human psychological and cultural experience.
